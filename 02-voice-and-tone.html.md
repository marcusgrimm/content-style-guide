title: Voice and Tone

One way we write empowering content is by being aware of our voice and our tone. This section explains the difference between voice and tone, and lays out the elements of each as they apply to Aster Pet Sciences.

What’s the difference between voice and tone? Think of it this way: You have the same voice all the time, but your tone changes. You might use one tone when you're out to dinner with your closest friends, and a different tone when you're in a meeting with your boss.

Your tone also changes depending on the emotional state of the person you’re addressing. You wouldn’t want to use the same tone of voice with someone who’s scared or upset as you would with someone who’s laughing.

The same is true for Aster Pet Sciences. Our voice doesn’t change much from day to day, but our tone changes all the time.

## Voice

At Aster Pet Sciences, we’re passionate about our dogs. We also know that supplements are a confusing category - often criticized by skeptics. That’s why we speak like the experienced and compassionate business partner we wish we’d had way back when. 

We treat every pet owner with respect. We want to educate people without patronizing or confusing them. 

Using offbeat humor and a conversational voice, we play with language to bring joy to their work. We prefer the subtle over the noisy, the wry over the farcical. We don't take ourselves too seriously.

Whether people know what they need from us or don’t know the first thing about pet supplements, every word we say informs and encourages. We impart our expertise with clarity, empathy, and wit. 

All of this means that when we write copy:

1. **We are plainspoken.** We understand the world our customers are living in: one muddled by in your face consumerism, upsells, and over-promises. We strip all that away and value clarity above all. Because consumers come to Aster Pet Sciences wanting to feel welcome, we aim to provide them community over all else.

2. **We are genuine.** We get dogs owners because we are dog owners. That means we relate to customers’ challenges and passions and speak to them in a familiar, warm, and accessible way. 

3. **We are translators.** Only experts can make what’s difficult look easy, and it’s our job to demystify the supplement business and actually educate.

4. **Our humor is dry.** Our sense of humor is straight-faced, subtle, and a touch eccentric. We’re weird but not inappropriate, smart but not snobbish. We prefer winking to shouting. We’re never condescending or exclusive—we always bring our customers in on the joke.

## Tone

Aster Pet Science’s tone is usually informal, but it’s always more important to be clear than entertaining. When you’re writing, consider the reader’s state of mind. Are they relieved to be finished with a product description? Are they confused and seeking our help on Twitter? Once you have an idea of their emotional state, you can adjust your tone accordingly.

Aster Pet Sciences has a sense of humor, so feel free to be funny when it’s appropriate and when it comes naturally to you. But don’t go out of your way to make a joke—forced humor can be worse than none at all. If you’re unsure, keep a straight face. Remember - many join our community because they're worried about the health of their dogs.
