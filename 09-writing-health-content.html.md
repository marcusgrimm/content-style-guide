Aster Pet Sciences publishes many kinds of content about the potential health benefits of our products. However, it's critical to understand that the health benefits of natural ingredients have not undergone the scrutiny required by the FDA and other governmental bodies. As such, how we speak about the potential benefits of our products matter. 

## Basics

The way we write, review, and publish content about products and/or ingredients is different than how we do many other kinds of writing at Aster Pet Sciences. The most important difference is that all health-related content either starts with or passes through the Baums.

But that doesn't mean health content has to be difficult to read. We try to present our legal information in the most pleasant way possible. Our goals for Aster Pet Sciences' healt content:

* **Accuracy.** Our first and foremost concern is that we present the correct information in a truthful way.
* **Clarity.** We try to avoid legal jargon and overly formal wording. Our users need to understand the agreement they’re making with us.
* **Succinctness.** We want our users to read and understand our health documents, while also respecting their time.

## Types of health content

We publish several types of legal documents, each with their own writing processes and goals.

## Guidelines

When writing legal content, generally follow the style points outlined in the [Voice and tone](/02-voice-and-tone.html.md) and [Grammar and mechanics](/04-grammar-and-mechanics.html.md) sections. Here are some more general considerations, too.

#### Start with the facts

We have some standard language that we use for common issues or requests, but since health content is so fact-specific, we start there before getting into structure and format. That’s why you won’t see many templates for our health content.

#### Use plain language

Health content is serious business, so the tone is slightly more formal than most of our content. That said, we want all of our users to be able to understand our health content. So whenever possible, we use plain language rather than legal jargon.

There are some terms we have to include whenever we are discussing the health benefits of our products. 

NOTE TO ASTER TEAM: Can we get some guidance for this section?

#### Never offer health advice

While we want to inform our users about health-related qualities of our products, we can’t offer them medical advice. Sometimes it’s a fine line. The Baums will check for this in their content review.
